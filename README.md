# Stocks_Analysis
need to install yfinance library for extracting data direvtly from yahoo finance website
import pandas  and matplotlib for analysis for stocks
from the extracted data we considered only data points required i.e; close, open, high, low price values only.

Problem faced:- while extracting data some column were empty and could have made analysis errorfull with such empty cells, we can use different data handeling techniques to fill those empty cells with relevent data.
